\section ct1 Control Toolbox

This is the ADRL Control Toolbox ('CT'), an open-source C++ library for efficient modelling, control, 
estimation, trajectory optimization and model predictive control.
The CT is applicable to a broad class of dynamic systems, but features additional modelling tools specially designed for robotics.
This page outlines its general concept, its major building blocks and highlights selected application examples.

The library contains several tools to design and evaluate controllers, model dynamical systems and solve optimal control problems.
The CT was designed with the following features in mind:

 - **Systems and dynamics**: 
	- intuitive modelling of systems governed by ordinary differential- or difference equations.

 - **Trajectory optimization, optimal control and (nonlinear) model predictive control**:
    - intuitive modelling of cost functions and constraints
    - common interfaces for optimal control solvers and nonlinear model predictive control
    - currently supported algorithms:
      - Single Shooting
      - iLQR \cite todorov2005ilqg / SLQ \cite slq:2005 
 	  - Gauss-Newton-Multiple-Shooting (GNMS) \cite giftthaler2017family
 	  - Classical Direct Multiple Shooting (DMS) \cite bock1984direct
 	- standardized interfaces for the solvers
 	  - IPOPT (first and second order)
      - SNOPT
      - HPIPM
      - custom Riccati-solver
 
 - **Performance**: 
 	- solve large scale optimal control problems in MPC fashion. 
  
 - **Robot Modelling and rigid body dynamics**: 
    - straight-forward interface to a state-of the art rigid body dynamics modelling tool.
 
 - **Automatic Differentiation**:
    - first- and second order automatic differentiation of arbitrary vector-valued functions including cost functions and constraints
    - automatic differentiation of rigid body dynamics
    - derivative code generation for maximum efficiency
 
 - **Simplicity**: 
    - all algorithm flavors and solver backends are available through simple configuration files.

\section teaser What is the CT?

A common tasks for researchers and practitioners in both the control and the robotics communities 
is to model systems, implement equations of motion and design model-based controllers, estimators, 
planning algorithms, etc.
Sooner or later, one is confronted with questions of efficient implementation, computing derivative 
information, formulating cost functions and constraints or running controllers in model-predictive 
control fashion.

The Control Toolbox is specifically designed for these tasks. It is written entirely in C++ and has 
a strong focus on highly efficient code that can be run online (in the loop) on robots or other 
actuated hardware. A major contribution of the CT is are its implementations of optimal control 
algorithms, spanning a range from simple LQR reference implementations to constrained model predictive 
control. The CT supports Automatic Differentiation (Auto-Diff) and allows to generate derivative code 
for arbitrary scalar and vector-valued functions. 
We designed the toolbox with usability in mind, allowing users to apply advanced concepts such as 
nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) or numerical optimal control easily and with minimal effort.
While we provide an interface to a state-of-the art Auto-Diff compatible robot modelling software, all 
other modules are independent of the a particular modelling framework, allowing the code to be interfaced 
with existing C/C++ code or libraries. 

The CT has been successfully used in a variety of different projects, including a large number of 
hardware experiments, demonstrations and academic publications. 
Example hardware applications are online trajectory optimization with collision 
avoidance \cite giftthaler2017autodiff, trajectory optimization for Quadrupeds \cite neunert:2017:ral 
and mobile manipulators \cite giftthaler2017efficient as well as NMPC on ground robots \cite neunert2017mpc 
and UAVs \cite neunert16hexrotor. The project originated from research conducted at the Agile \& Dexterous 
Robotics Lab at ETH Zurich, but is continuously extended to cover more fields of applications and algorithms.
 

\section scope Scope of the CT

 Software is one of the key building blocks for robotic systems and there is a great effort 
 in creating software tools and libraries for robotics. 
 However, when it comes to control and especially Numerical Optimal Control, there are not 
 many open source tools available that are both easy to use for fast development as well as 
 efficient enough for online usage. 
 While there exist mature toolboxes for Numerical Optimal Control and Trajectory Optimization, 
 they are highly specialized, standalone tools that due not provide sufficient flexibility 
 for other applications. Here is where the CT steps in. The CT has been designed from ground 
 up to provide the tools needed for fast development and evaluation of control methods while 
 being optimized for efficiency allowing for online operation. While the emphasis lies on control, 
 the tools provided can also be used for simulation, estimation or optimization applications.

 In contrast to other robotic software, CT is not a rigid integrated application but can be 
 seen quite literal as a toolbox: It offers a variety of tools which can be used and combined 
 to solve a task at hand. While ease-of-use has been a major criteria during the design and 
 application examples are provided, using CT still requires programming and control knowledge. 
 However, it frees the users from implementing standard methods that require in-depth experience 
 with linear algebra or numerical methods. Furthermore, by using common definitions and types, 
 a seamless integration between different components such as systems, controllers or integrators 
 is provided, enabling fast prototyping.


\section design Design and Implementation

The main focus of CT is efficiency, which is why it is fully implemented in C++. 
Since CT is designed as a toolbox rather than an integrated application, we tried to provide 
maximum flexibility to the users. Therefore, it is not tied to a specific middleware such as 
ROS and dependencies are kept at a minimum. The two essential dependencies for CT are
<a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org" target="_blank">Eigen</a> and 
<a href="http://github.com/ethz-asl/kindr" target="_blank">Kindr</a>
(which is based on Eigen). This Eigen dependency is intentional since Eigen
is a defacto standard for linear algebra in C++, as it provides highly efficient implementations 
of standard matrix operations as well as more advanced linear algebra methods. 
Kindr is a header only Kinematics library which builds on top of it and provides data types 
for different rotation representations such as Quaternions, Euler angles or rotation matrices.


\section modules Structure and Modules of the CT

The Control Toolbox consists of three main modules. The Core module (ct_core), the Optimal 
Control (ct_optcon) module and the rigid body dynamics (ct_rbd) module. 
There is a clear hierarchy between the modules. 
That means, the modules depend on each other in this order, e.g. you can use the core module 
without the optcon or rbd module.
 - The `core' module (ct_core) module provides general type definitions and mathematical tools.
For example, it contains most data type definitions, definitions for systems and controllers, 
as well as basic functionality such as numerical integrators for differential equations. 
 - The `optimal Control' module (ct_optcon) builds on top of the `core' module and adds 
infrastructure for defining and solving Optimal Control Problems. It contains the functionality
for defining cost functions, constraints, solver backends and a general MPC wrapper.
 - The `rigid body dynamics' module (ct_rbd) provides tools for modelling Rigid Body Dynamics 
systems and interfaces with ct_core and ct_optcon data types. 

For testing as well as examples, we also provide the 'models' module (ct_models) which contains 
various robot models including a quadruped, a robotic arm, a normal quadrotor and a quadrotor 
with slung load. 

The four different main modules are detailed in the following.
